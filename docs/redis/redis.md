# Redis

Redis allows for creating Redis servers, which is a good way to do e.g. Cache in your app.

This means if you need to fetch large amounts of the same data from your app, you can cache the data in Redis.

When creating a Redis product, you get your own server, only used for that specific environment, meaning no shared data with other clients. Even on the free plan.
