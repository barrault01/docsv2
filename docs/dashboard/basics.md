# Dashboard Basics

The dashboard in Vapor Cloud 2 is an easy way to interact with your workloads on Vapor Cloud. This page will give you the highlights of how to use it.

## Search

At the top of the Dashboard, there is a Search field. This searches for Applications across all organizations you have access to. Once you start typing, it will automatically start showing you results.

Under the application view page, there are several, dynamic cards. These show various features of the application and are your primary method of interaction.

On each card, there can be zero or more main action buttons. These help you perform common tasks quickly, like deploying or scaling your application. 

On some cards, there can be a "more" button in the top right corner. Clicking the more button gives access to less common tasks, like viewing database credentials.
