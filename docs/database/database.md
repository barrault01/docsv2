# Database

Vapor Cloud supports two different database engines `MySQL` and `PostgreSQL`.

Depending on the plan, there are two different ways the databases are issued:

| Plan | Provision |
| ---- | --------- |
| Dev - Free | A database on a shared server |
| Dev - Hobby | A database on a shared server |
| Standard-* | Own database server |

Dev plans are row limited, and there are no customization of the system. There are also minimal flexibility in versions.

For Standard-* plans, you get your own server, and are able to setup IP Whitelisting to only allow specific ips access for security.
You are also able to customize parts of the configuration to fit your need.
